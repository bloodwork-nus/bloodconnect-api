# The BloodConnect API
This repository contains the (production stage) cloud functions for BloodConnect.

### Developer's guide (to be removed)
For local development, install the Firebase CLI with `npm install firebase-tools --global` or `yarn global add firebase-tools`.
Note that this is as far as you will go using `yarn`. Firebase currently only supports Node 8 or 10. Different engine versions
might conflict with `yarn` and it is recommended to continue with `npm` for greater stability. Unless you decide to use
`yarn --ignore-engine`, then fair enough. **BloodConnect API uses `npm`.**
